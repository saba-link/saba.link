    <div class="content prose">
        <p class="drop-cap">For most of my career, I worked at a public company. The financials were transparent. Quarterly reports, analyst calls, stock price. If I wanted to understand how the company was doing, I could look it up.</p>

        <p>Then I started evaluating startups as potential employers. Series B companies. Series C. Names I'd heard, products I admired. And I realized something uncomfortable: <span class="hl">I had no idea how to evaluate them financially</span>.</p>

        <p>What does "Series B" actually mean? Is €20M ARR good at that stage? What happens to my equity if there's a down round? These weren't hypothetical questions anymore. They were decision-critical.</p>

        <p>So I did what engineers do: I learned the domain. This post is what I wish someone had explained to me when I started.</p>

        <h2 id="funding-is-fuel-not-success">Funding is fuel, not success</h2>

        <p>Let's start with the most important mental model: <strong>raising money is not an achievement</strong>. It's fuel. A startup that raises a lot of money isn't automatically healthy. It might just need a lot of capital to operate, or it's burning through cash faster than expected.</p>

        <blockquote class="pullquote">A €100M funding round sounds impressive until you learn they're spending €15M per month with no path to profitability.</blockquote>

        <p>When you see a headline like "Startup X raises €50M Series C," the right question isn't "wow, they must be doing great." It's: why do they need that money, and what will they do with it?</p>

        <h2 id="who-invests-at-each-stage">Who invests at each stage</h2>

        <p>Different investors play at different stages. Understanding this helps you decode a company's trajectory.</p>

        <h3>Early stages (Pre-Seed, Seed)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Angel investors</strong> — individuals, often ex-founders, writing €10K-€500K checks</li>
            <li><strong>Accelerators</strong> — Y Combinator, Techstars, providing money plus programs for 7-10% equity</li>
            <li><strong>Seed VCs</strong> — specialized early-stage funds</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Growth stages (Series A+)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Venture Capital</strong> — institutional funds like Sequoia, Index, Accel</li>
            <li><strong>Growth Equity</strong> — later-stage specialists like General Atlantic</li>
            <li><strong>Corporate VC</strong> — strategic investors like Google Ventures, Salesforce Ventures</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The bootstrapped outliers</h3>
        <p>Not every unicorn follows the VC playbook. Zscaler, for example, bootstrapped for years before taking outside capital in 2012 — a full decade after founding. They went public in 2018 at a $1.9B valuation and are now worth over $25B.</p>

        <p>For candidates, these companies often have different DNA: more focus on capital efficiency, less "growth at all costs" pressure, and founders who've retained significant control. The culture tends to be more pragmatic. Whether that's a pro or con depends on what you're looking for.</p>

        <p>As a candidate, pay attention to who invested. <span class="hl">Tier-1 VCs</span> (Sequoia, a16z/Andreessen Horowitz, Benchmark, Index) signal that serious due diligence was done. Unknown investors or only strategic investors can be yellow flags.</p>

        <h2 id="the-funding-rounds-explained">The funding rounds, explained</h2>

        <p>Here's what actually happens at each stage:</p>

                    <td>€5M-€20M</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Series C</td>
                    <td>€50M-€150M</td>
                    <td>€20M-€100M</td>
                    <td>150-500</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Series D+</td>
                    <td>€100M+</td>
                    <td>€50M+</td>
                    <td>500+</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>I've highlighted Series B because for many ICs, <span class="hl">this is the sweet spot</span>: enough validation that the company works, but still early enough for meaningful equity. The company has found product-market fit, has a real go-to-market engine, but isn't yet a mini-corporation.</p>

        <h3>What each stage feels like from the inside</h3>

        <p><strong>Seed:</strong> You're joining a bet. Below-market salary (20-40% less), significant equity, high risk. Good if you want the founding team experience.</p>

        <p><strong>Series A:</strong> Still risky, but something's been validated. Salary closer to market (10-20% under), equity still meaningful. The company is figuring out how to scale.</p>

        <p><strong>Series B:</strong> The go-to-market engine is running. Real management layers form. Market-rate salaries become possible. This is where I'd tell most experienced ICs to look: enough proof that it works, enough upside that it matters.</p>

        <p><strong>Series C+:</strong> Lower risk, lower equity upside. Starting to feel like a real company. Good benefits, clear processes. The IPO conversation starts.</p>

        <h2 id="understanding-valuations">Understanding valuations</h2>

        <p>Here's a concept that confused me: <strong>pre-money vs. post-money valuation</strong>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-money:</strong> what the company is worth before the investment</li>
            <li><strong>Post-money:</strong> pre-money + investment amount</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Example: A company has a €10M pre-money valuation. Investors put in €2.5M. Post-money is €12.5M. The investors now own €2.5M / €12.5M = 20%.</p>

        <blockquote class="pullquote">Higher valuation means less dilution for existing shareholders. But valuations that are too high create down-round risk later.</blockquote>

        <p>Why does this matter to you? Because your equity percentage is calculated against total shares. If the company keeps raising at higher valuations, you dilute less. If there's a down round, you dilute more, and your options might be underwater.</p>

        <h2 id="warning-signs-to-watch-for">Warning signs to watch for</h2>

        <p>When evaluating a startup, these patterns should make you ask harder questions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bridge rounds</strong> — small raises between "real" rounds, often meaning runway is running out faster than planned</li>
            <li><strong>Down rounds</strong> — raising at a lower valuation than before. Your equity just got diluted badly.</li>
            <li><strong>Too many rounds too fast</strong> — healthy companies take 18-24 months between rounds. Less than 12 months might mean they're burning cash.</li>
            <li><strong>Only strategic investors</strong> — no financial VCs could signal that the business model doesn't pencil for traditional returns</li>
            <li><strong>"Stealth mode" at Series B+</strong> — why is a company with €10M+ ARR hiding? What are they not telling you?</li>
        </ul>

                <li><strong>What's your current runway?</strong> — How many months of cash do they have?</li>
                <li><strong>When's the next round planned?</strong> — And at what expected valuation?</li>
                <li><strong>What's the current ARR and growth rate?</strong> — Does it match the stage?</li>

        <h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>

        <p>Startup funding isn't magic. It's a system with knowable rules. Once you understand how it works, you can make better decisions about where to work.</p>

        <p>The goal isn't to become a finance expert. It's to ask the right questions and recognize when something doesn't add up. A company that's evasive about runway or valuation is telling you something. Listen.</p>

        <p>In the next post, I'll cover how to evaluate the equity component of your offer specifically, including what your options might actually be worth.</p>
